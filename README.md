## Design of the library

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `options/` | (More or less) OS-independent headers and code.<br>`options/` is divided into subdirectories that can be enabled or disabled by ports.|
| `sysdeps/` | OS-specific headers and code.<br>`sysdeps/` is divded into per-port subdirectories. Exactly one of those subdirectories is enabled in each build.|
| `abis/` | OS-specific interface headers ("ABI headers"). Those contain the constants and structs of the OS interface. For example, the numerical values of `SEEK_SET` or `O_CREAT` live here, as well as structs like `struct stat`. ABI headers are _only_ allowed to contain constants, structs and unions but _no_ function declarations or logic.<br>`abis/` is divided into per-OS subdirectories but this division is for organizational purposes only. Ports can still mix headers from different `abis/` subdirectories.|

**Porting mlibc to a new OS**: Ports to new OSes are welcome. To port mlibc to another OS, the following changes need to be made:
1. Add new `sysdeps/` subdirectory `sysdeps/some-new-os/` and a `meson.build` to compile it. Integreate `sysdeps/some-new-os/meson.build` into the toplevel `meson.build`.
2. Create ABI headers in `abis/some-new-os/`. Add symlinks in `sysdeps/some-new-os/include/abi-bits` to your ABI headers. Look at existing ports to figure out the ABI headers required for the options enabled by `sysdeps/some-new-os/meson.build`.
3. In `sysdeps/some-new-os/`, add code to implement (a subset of) the functions from `options/internal/include/mlibc/sysdeps.hpp`. Which subset you need depends on the options that `sysdeps/some-new-os/meson.build` enables.

## Local Development

The `mlibc` test suite can be run under a Linux host. To do this, first run from the project root:
```
meson -Dbuild_tests=true build
```
This will create a `build` directory. Then, `cd build` and run the tests (showing output) with:
```
meson test -v
```

## Building for [ytret/os](https://github.com/ytret/os)

Generally these commands are used to build and install the library:

```
$ meson builddir --cross-file ci/myos.cross-file
$ cd builddir
$ DESTDIR=/path/to/sysroot ninja install
```

However, more specific instructions are available at [ytret/os/toolchain/README.md](https://github.com/ytret/os/blob/master/toolchain/README.md) in the context of building a hosted GCC compiler.
