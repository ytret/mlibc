/*
 * Explanation of cancellation bits:
 *
 * tcbCancelEnableBit and tcbCancelAsyncBit should be self-explanatory,
 * they are set if cancellation is enabled, or asynchronous, respectively.
 *
 * tcbCancelTriggerBit is set whenever a cancellation is triggered, which is
 * in pthread_cancel() or in the signal handler. This bit is used by
 * pthread_testcancel() to check whether a cancellation has been requested,
 * and also by cancellable syscalls.
 *
 * tcbCancelingBit is set when a cancellation is currently being handled. This
 * is to avoid a situation in which a cancellation handler gets interrupted by
 * a SIGCANCEL and a second cancellation handler gets executed on top of the
 * previous one. Right now this cannot happen, since we stay in signal handler
 * context when canceling/exiting. In the future this might be done outside
 * of a signal handler, in which case we shouldn't restart the cancellation process.
 *
 * tcbExitingBit is set when the thread starts the exit procedure. Currently
 * this is just an exit, but in the future this will be a stack unwinding
 * procedure, which shouldn't be reentered. Not currently set anywhere,
 * may be done so in the future.
 *
 * TODO(geert): update this comment when we do unwinding in the exit procedure.
